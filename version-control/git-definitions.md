# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the process of creating unique stored copies of changes made to a file as they are made by particular contributors. It is useful because it allows any contributors to revert to any particular instance of a code change atany point in the future. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a sub-folder of git repository for tracking changes to a particular feature that is being editted. This is useful because it organizes the versions related to that particular feature separately from other changes that may be occuring in real-time.  
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A 'commit' is a git command that memorializes the version in the git repository. A good commit message identifies the specific changes made in that version as accurately and succinctly as possible.  
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when code from one branch version creates an error when combined with the version from another branch.
